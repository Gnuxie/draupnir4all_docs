## Guide

This guide covers the necessary bits. As the project evolves, it will only become more comprehensive

### Getting started

To start editing the documentation you will need to install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

From there you can run `hugo serve`, a URL will be shown for where to view a live view of
the documentation. Any changes you make will automatically be served from this view.

You can learn more about hugo [here](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
