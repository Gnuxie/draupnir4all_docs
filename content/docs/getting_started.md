## Registration

Registration is needed both to provide a way to ratelimit users for scaling the
service as well as because the bot uses a whitelist.

{{< tip "warning" >}}
In the early stages I am going to limit the amount of people that can register to figure out
proper scaling of the components. There will be announcements on the status page when the
registrations are paused.
{{< /tip >}}

To register you need to write an email to <draupnir4all@nordgedanken.dev>.

Inside of the email you need to provide these infos:

- The matrix ID of the person that is the admin of the provisioned bot.
- An estimate of the amount of rooms going to be moderated. This doesn't need to be accurate
but helps estimating the resources needed in the early stages.

After you have sent the email you will get a reply by me (MTRNord) when you are registered
with further instructions how to get your draupnir instance.
